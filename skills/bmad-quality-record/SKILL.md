# Quality Record Generation Workflow

**Goal:** Generate a Quality Record (QR) from a completed story (S-NNN), capturing test results, AC verification, DoD verification, code review, and making an approval decision. QR is Gate 3 in the methodology chain.

**Your Role:** You are a QA Engineer generating quality records. Parse story files, run or inspect tests, verify acceptance criteria and definitions of done, perform code review, and produce a complete QR record.

## Conventions

- Bare paths (e.g. `checklist.md`) resolve from the skill root.
- `{skill-root}` resolves to this skill's installed directory (where `customize.toml` lives).
- `{project-root}`-prefixed paths resolve from the project working directory.
- `{skill-name}` resolves to the skill directory's basename.

## On Activation

### Step 1: Resolve the Workflow Block

Run: `python3 {metodoloji-root}/hooks/engine/resolve_customization.py --skill {skill-root} --key workflow` — the OpenHands terminal tool accepts only the command parameter; do NOT add description

**If the script fails**, resolve the `workflow` block yourself by reading these three files in base → team → user order and applying the same structural merge rules as the resolver:

1. `{skill-root}/customize.toml` — defaults
2. `{metodoloji-root}/custom/{skill-name}.toml` — team overrides
3. `{metodoloji-root}/custom/{skill-name}.user.toml` — personal overrides

Any missing file is skipped. Scalars override, tables deep-merge, arrays of tables keyed by `code` or `id` replace matching entries and append new entries, and all other arrays append.

### Step 2: Execute Prepend Steps

Execute each entry in `{workflow.activation_steps_prepend}` in order before proceeding.

### Step 3: Load Persistent Facts

Treat every entry in `{workflow.persistent_facts}` as foundational context you carry for the rest of the workflow run. Entries prefixed `file:` are paths or globs under `{project-root}` — load the referenced contents as facts. All other entries are facts verbatim.

### Step 4: Load Config

Resolve config by running: `python3 {metodoloji-root}/bmad/scripts/resolve_config.py --project-root {project-root} --module bmm` (merges plugin defaults with `{project-root}` overrides; project values win). Resolve:

- `project_name`, `user_name`
- `communication_language`, `document_output_language`
- `implementation_artifacts`
- `planning_artifacts`
- `quality_artifacts` (where QR records live, typically `docs/quality`)
- `date` as system-generated current datetime
- `project_context` = `**/project-context.md` (load if exists)
- YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT in your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`
- Generate all documents in `{document_output_language}`

### Step 5: Greet the User

Greet `{user_name}`, speaking in `{communication_language}`. Ask which story (S-XXX) needs a QR record.

### Step 6: Execute Append Steps

Execute each entry in `{workflow.activation_steps_append}` in order.

Activation is complete. If `activation_steps_prepend` or `activation_steps_append` were non-empty, confirm every entry was executed in order before proceeding. Do not begin the main workflow until all activation steps have been completed.

## Paths

- `tracking_system` = `file-system`
- `project_key` = `NOKEY`
- `story_location` = `{implementation_artifacts}/stories`
- `quality_location` = `{quality_artifacts}`
- `qr_pattern` = `QR-*.md`

## Input Files

| Input | Path | Load Strategy |
|-------|------|---------------|
| Story | `{story_location}/S-XXX.md` (identified by user or from context) | FULL_LOAD |
| PR/Branch info | Git or user input | PROVIDED_BY_USER |
| Test results | Project test runner output | DISCOVERED_OR_PROVIDED |

## Execution

<workflow>

<step n="1" goal="Identify the story and load its content">
<action>Ask user for story ID (S-XXX) if not provided in context</action>

  - Definition of Done (DoD-001, DoD-002, ... — must include identifier and Evidence)
  - Sprint reference (SP-id)
  - Epic reference (E-id)
  - Implementation details (branch, PR, or user provides)
  - Current status (should be "review" or "done")

<action>If story is not in review or done status, warn user: "Story must be in 'review' or 'done' status to create QR. Current: {status}". Exit or continue at user discretion.</action>
</step>

<step n="2" goal="Gather test results and metrics">
<action>Ask user to provide or point to:</action>

  - Branch/PR information (GitHub PR link, branch name, number of changed files, ±lines)

<action>If test results not available:</action>
  - [ ] Ask user if tests were run locally — if yes, ask for output
  - [ ] Ask user if CI/CD pipeline was used — if yes, ask for pipeline link/ID
  - [ ] If no tests available, mark as "pending" and record that in QR

<action>Parse or normalize test results into:</action>

  - Coverage: Z% (target: 80%)
  - Linter: PASS or FAIL (list errors if any)

  - Perf regression: NO or YES (% change if yes)
</step>

<step n="3" goal="Verify Acceptance Criteria">
<action>For each AC from the story:</action>
  - Extract AC-id, description, and Verify: method
  - Run or ask user to verify using the Verify: method

```

<action>If all ACs verified → "AC verification complete (3/3)"</action>
<action>If some pending → record which ones and why</action>

</step>

<step n="5" goal="Conduct code review">
<action>Ask user for:</action>

<action>If breaking change:</action>
  - Record migration plan

  - Mark as requires communication to stakeholders

<action>If tech debt:</action>
  - Record tech debt details

</step>

<step n="7" goal="Make approval decision">
<action>Evaluate all checks:</action>

**Mechanical (mandatory):**

  - [ ] Technical debt recorded?

<action>Decision logic:</action>

| Condition | Decision |
|-----------|----------|
| All mechanical ✓ + At least 1 code review ✓ + Docs ✓ | **APPROVED** → proceed to merge |
| Any mechanical ✗ | **REJECTED** → fix and resubmit |
| Code review "CHANGES REQUESTED" | **REJECTED** → address feedback |
| Some DoD/AC ⏳ pending but no failures | **APPROVED WITH COMMENTS** → can merge if acceptable risk |
| Any critical check ✗ | **REJECTED** → fix required |

<action>Record decision:</action>

```
## Decision

- **Decision:** APPROVED | REJECTED | APPROVED WITH COMMENTS
- **Rationale:** {Why approved or why rejected}
- **Rejection reason (if any):**
  - {Reason 1}
  - {Reason 2}
- **Next step:** merge | revision required | staging test | production deploy

  - [ ] Breaking changes and tech debt sections
  - [ ] Decision section with clear APPROVED/REJECTED status
  - [ ] Gate 3 checklist (all items reviewed)

<action>Write QR file to: {quality_location}/QR-{id}.md</action>
</step>

<step n="9" goal="Update story status and handoff">
<action>If decision = APPROVED:</action>
  - [ ] Update story (S-XXX) status to "done" (or "review" if QR pending another check)

  - [ ] Update sprint status to reflect story completion

<action>If decision = REJECTED:</action>
  - [ ] Update story status to "blocked" or revert to "in-progress"
  - [ ] Add comment explaining rejection
  - [ ] Note next steps in story

<action>Post handoff notification:</action>

```
python3 {metodoloji-root}/bmad/scripts/blackboard.py handoff --to bmad-production-readiness --from-key quality-record --note "QR-{id} approved for S-XXX. Ready for production readiness check."

<step n="10" goal="Validate and report">
<action>Perform validation:</action>
  - [ ] QR file created and readable

**AC Verification:** X verified / Y pending / Z failed
**DoD Verification:** X passed / Y pending / Z failed
**Code Review:** APPROVED / CHANGES REQUESTED

**Next Steps (if approved):**
1. Story S-XXX marked as "done"
2. Handoff notification sent to bmad-production-readiness
3. Ready for production readiness check

<action>Run: `python3 {metodoloji-root}/hooks/engine/resolve_customization.py --skill {skill-root} --key workflow.on_complete` — the OpenHands terminal tool accepts only the command parameter; do NOT add description — if the resolved value is non-empty, follow it as the final terminal instruction before exiting.</action>

## Gate 3 Checklist

Quality Record generation enforces **Gate 3** of the methodology chain:
- All mechanical checks (tests, security, performance) must pass
- All acceptance criteria must be verified
- All definitions of done must be satisfied
- Code review must approve
- Documentation must be updated
- Only then: QR is marked APPROVED and story can proceed to production readiness

This gate prevents low-quality code from reaching production.

## Status Values for QR

- **in-review**: QR being created or reviewed
- **APPROVED**: All checks passed, ready for production readiness
- **REJECTED**: Checks failed, story needs revision
- **REVISED**: QR was revised after initial review
