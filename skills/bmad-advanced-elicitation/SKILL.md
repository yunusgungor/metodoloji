## Methodology

Bound to `{metodoloji-root}/docs/bmad/research-methodology.md` — Mode B (qualitative) — deep critique, rethinking.
Produces no methodology record of its own: enhancements return to the invoking skill and land in its output.
A documentary decision is not code-writing permission; code always requires Mode A mechanical approval
(`/metodoloji:verify` + guard hook). Fabricated evidence/measurements are fraud.


# Advanced Elicitation

**Goal:** Push the LLM to reconsider, refine, and improve its recent output.

---

## CRITICAL LLM INSTRUCTIONS

- **MANDATORY:** Execute ALL steps in the flow section IN EXACT ORDER (Step 0 first)
- DO NOT skip steps or change the sequence (Step 0's headless shortcut is part of the sequence, not a skip)
- HALT immediately at each `HALT to await response` point in Step 2 (`y/n` confirmation, `1-5,r,a,x` prompt); in headless mode Step 0 replaces those HALTs with the single-pass return
- Each action within a step is a REQUIRED action to complete that step
- INTEGRATION applies whenever this skill is invoked from another skill; Execution Guidelines apply throughout
- **YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT in your Agent communication style with the `communication_language`**

---

## INTEGRATION (When Invoked Indirectly)

When invoked from another prompt or process:

1. Receive or review the current section content that was just generated
2. Apply elicitation methods iteratively to enhance that specific content
3. Return the enhanced version back when user selects 'x' to proceed and return back
4. The enhanced content replaces the original section content in the output document

---

## FLOW

### Step 0: Activation (runs once, before Step 1)

1. Resolve customization: `python3 {metodoloji-root}/hooks/engine/resolve_customization.py --skill {skill-root} --key workflow` — on failure, read `{skill-root}/customize.toml` directly and use defaults. Hold each `{workflow.persistent_facts}` entry as session context and run each `{workflow.activation_steps_append}` entry.
2. Resolve config: `python3 {metodoloji-root}/bmad/scripts/resolve_config.py --project-root {project-root} --module core`; resolve `{user_name}`, `{communication_language}`. Missing → neutral defaults; never block. This grounds the `communication_language` in CRITICAL LLM INSTRUCTIONS.
3. Inherit the blackboard: `python3 {metodoloji-root}/bmad/scripts/blackboard.py read --context --project-root {project-root}` — this shows the invoking skill's live focus (hot key preview, scope/status bridge, tags, last contributions, chain alerts) so method selection and critique ground in the run. Fail-open: missing/corrupt board → proceed from caller inputs alone. Note the hot key — it names this session in the close-out trace. (`read --context` is a compact summary: it does NOT carry the `purpose` value or run-list contents — peek those separately.) Then peek the session subject: `python3 {metodoloji-root}/bmad/scripts/blackboard.py read --key purpose --project-root {project-root}` (the one-line subject; absent → `value: null`). For the invoking run's open threads, resolve the run-list key from the hot key (`<hot-key>.pending`, falling back to the `.open` / `.parked` / `.branches` / `.failing` vocabulary the caller uses) and peek it: `python3 {metodoloji-root}/bmad/scripts/blackboard.py read --key <run-list-key> --project-root {project-root}` (missing key → `value: null` — proceed without threads). This skill never touches focus, bridge keys, run lists, canvases, links, subscriptions, or hand-offs (`write`, `list-add`, `list-remove`, `list-clear`, `handoff`, `canvas`, `link`, `unlink`, `subscribe`, `unsubscribe`, `consume`, `notify`, `tag`, `untag`, `hot` are forbidden here) — those stay owned by the invoking skill, which folds the returned enhancements into its own close-out. The single permitted write is the close-out `contribute` in Case x.
4. Detect headless: caller sets `headless: true`, invocation comes from another skill or a non-interactive runner (no TTY, no user message stream), or the first message pre-supplies content and asks for enhanced content back. When in doubt, you are interactive. If headless, skip all prompts and HALTs in Step 2: pick the single best-fit method from Smart Selection, apply it once to the current content, record the close-out contribution (same format as Case x), return the enhanced content to the caller, and end.

### Step 1: Method Registry Loading

**Action:** Load `{skill-root}/methods.csv` for elicitation methods. If collaboration methods may need voices and no active party roster is already in memory, resolve the installed agents via:

```bash
python3 {metodoloji-root}/bmad/scripts/resolve_config.py --project-root {project-root} --key agents
```

This returns installed agents (not the live party room — the party room is owned by `bmad-party-mode` via its `resolve_party.py`); if a party is already active in this session, reuse its in-memory roster instead. Each entry under `agents` is keyed by the agent's `code` and carries `name`, `title`, `icon`, `description`, `module`, and `team`.

#### CSV Structure

- **category:** Method grouping (core, structural, risk, etc.)
- **method_name:** Display name for the method
- **description:** Rich explanation of what the method does, when to use it, and why it's valuable
- **output_pattern:** Flexible flow guide using arrows (e.g., "analysis -> insights -> action")

#### Context Analysis

- Use conversation history
- Analyze: content type, complexity, stakeholder needs, risk level, and creative potential

#### Smart Selection

1. Analyze context: Content type, complexity, stakeholder needs, risk level, creative potential
2. Parse descriptions: Understand each method's purpose from the rich descriptions in CSV
3. Select 5 methods: Choose methods that best match the context based on their descriptions
4. Balance approach: Include mix of foundational and specialized techniques as appropriate

---

### Step 2: Present Options and Handle Responses

#### Display Format

```
**Advanced Elicitation Options**
_If party mode is active, agents will join in._
Choose a number (1-5), [r] to Reshuffle, [a] List All, or [x] to Proceed:

1. [Method Name]
2. [Method Name]
3. [Method Name]
4. [Method Name]
5. [Method Name]
r. Reshuffle the list with 5 new options
a. List all methods with descriptions
x. Proceed / No Further Actions
```

#### Response Handling

**Case 1-5 (User selects a numbered method):**

- Execute the selected method using its description from the CSV
- Adapt the method's complexity and output format based on the current context
- Apply the method creatively to the current section content being enhanced
- Display the enhanced version showing what the method revealed or improved
- **CRITICAL:** Ask the user if they would like to apply the changes to the doc (y/n/other) and HALT to await response.
- **CRITICAL:** ONLY if Yes, apply the changes. IF No, discard your memory of the proposed changes. If any other reply, try best to follow the instructions given by the user.
- **CRITICAL:** Re-present the same 1-5,r,a,x prompt to allow additional elicitations

**Case r (Reshuffle):**

- Select 5 random methods from methods.csv, present new list with same prompt format
- When selecting, try to think and pick a diverse set of methods covering different categories and approaches, with 1 and 2 being potentially the most useful for the document or section being discovered

**Case x (Proceed):**

- Complete elicitation and proceed
- Return the fully enhanced content back to the invoking skill
- The enhanced content becomes the final version for that section
- Leave one trace on the board (the only write this skill makes): `python3 {metodoloji-root}/bmad/scripts/blackboard.py contribute --who bmad-advanced-elicitation --what "elicit on <hot key or purpose>: <method names applied>" --project-root {project-root}` (names the invoking run's session and the methods applied, one line; fail-open — board errors never block the return)
- Signal completion back to the invoking skill to continue with next section

**Case a (List All):**

- List all methods with their descriptions from the CSV in a compact table
- Allow user to select any method by name or number from the full list
- After selection, execute the method as described in the Case 1-5 above

**Case: Direct Feedback:**

- Apply changes to current section content and re-present choices

**Case: Multiple Numbers:**

- Execute methods in sequence on the content, then re-offer choices

---

### Step 3: Execution Guidelines

- **Method execution:** Use the description from CSV to understand and apply each method
- **Output pattern:** Use the pattern as a flexible guide (e.g., "paths -> evaluation -> selection")
- **Dynamic adaptation:** Adjust complexity based on content needs (simple to sophisticated)
- **Creative application:** Interpret methods flexibly based on context while maintaining pattern consistency
- Focus on actionable insights
- **Stay relevant:** Tie elicitation to specific content being analyzed (the current section from the document being created unless user indicates otherwise)
- **Identify personas:** For single or multi-persona methods, clearly identify viewpoints, and use party members if available in memory already
- **Critical loop behavior:** Always re-offer the 1-5,r,a,x choices after each method execution
- Continue until user selects 'x' to proceed with enhanced content, confirm or ask the user what should be accepted from the session
- Each method application builds upon previous enhancements
- **Content preservation:** Track all enhancements made during elicitation
- **Iterative enhancement:** Each selected method (1-5) should:
  1. Apply to the current enhanced version of the content
  2. Show the improvements made
  3. Return to the prompt for additional elicitations or completion
