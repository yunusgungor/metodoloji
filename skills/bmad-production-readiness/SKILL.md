# Production Readiness Generation Workflow

**Goal:** Generate a Production Readiness (PR) record from approved quality records (QR), verifying staging deployment, rollback plan, monitoring, feature flags, runbook, and operational readiness. PR is Gate 4 in the methodology chain.

**Your Role:** You are a DevOps/Release Engineer generating production readiness records. Parse approved QRs, verify staging tests, define rollback plans, set up monitoring and alerts, and produce a complete PR record to gate production deployment.

## Conventions

- Bare paths (e.g. `checklist.md`) resolve from the skill root.
- `{skill-root}` resolves to this skill's installed directory (where `customize.toml` lives).
- `{project-root}`-prefixed paths resolve from the project working directory.
- `{skill-name}` resolves to the skill directory's basename.

## On Activation

### Step 1: Resolve the Workflow Block

Run: `python3 {metodoloji-root}/hooks/engine/resolve_customization.py --skill {skill-root} --key workflow` — the OpenHands terminal tool accepts only the command parameter; do NOT add description

**If the script fails**, resolve the `workflow` block yourself by reading these three files in base → team → user order and applying the same structural merge rules as the resolver:

1. `{skill-root}/customize.toml` — defaults
2. `{metodoloji-root}/custom/{skill-name}.toml` — team overrides
3. `{metodoloji-root}/custom/{skill-name}.user.toml` — personal overrides

Any missing file is skipped. Scalars override, tables deep-merge, arrays of tables keyed by `code` or `id` replace matching entries and append new entries, and all other arrays append.

### Step 2: Execute Prepend Steps

Execute each entry in `{workflow.activation_steps_prepend}` in order before proceeding.

### Step 3: Load Persistent Facts

Treat every entry in `{workflow.persistent_facts}` as foundational context you carry for the rest of the workflow run. Entries prefixed `file:` are paths or globs (`{metodoloji-root}/…` resolves against the plugin root; other paths under `{project-root}`) — load the referenced contents as facts. All other entries are facts verbatim.

### Step 4: Load Config

Resolve config by running: `python3 {metodoloji-root}/bmad/scripts/resolve_config.py --project-root {project-root} --module bmm` (merges plugin defaults with `{project-root}` overrides; project values win). Resolve:

- `project_name`, `user_name`
- `communication_language`, `document_output_language`
- `implementation_artifacts`
- `planning_artifacts`
- `quality_artifacts` (where QR records live)
- `deployment_artifacts` (where PR records live, typically `docs/development`)
- `date` as system-generated current datetime
- `project_context` = `**/project-context.md` (load if exists)
- YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT in your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`
- Generate all documents in `{document_output_language}`

### Step 5: Greet the User

Greet `{user_name}`, speaking in `{communication_language}`. Ask about release scope: which QR records (approved quality records) are going into this production release?

### Step 6: Execute Append Steps

Execute each entry in `{workflow.activation_steps_append}` in order.

### Step 7: Chain Handshake

Check for signals addressed to you before the workflow begins: `python3 {metodoloji-root}/bmad/scripts/blackboard.py handoffs --skill bmad-production-readiness --project-root {project-root}` — the canonical sender is a `bmad-quality-record` run whose note names the approved QR records to pull from. Read the named QR records first (step 1 re-verifies each decision is APPROVED), then complete the handshake: `python3 {metodoloji-root}/bmad/scripts/blackboard.py consume --channel handoff.bmad-production-readiness --project-root {project-root}` (consume only after the named QR records are located — an unconsumed signal keeps the hand-off waiting, which is correct when the user routes elsewhere).

Activation is complete. If `activation_steps_prepend` or `activation_steps_append` were non-empty, confirm every entry was executed in order before proceeding. Do not begin the main workflow until all activation steps have been completed.

## Paths

- `tracking_system` = `file-system`
- `project_key` = `NOKEY`
- `quality_location` = `{quality_artifacts}`
- `deployment_location` = `{deployment_artifacts}`
- `pr_pattern` = `PR-*.md`

## Input Files

| Input | Path | Load Strategy |
|-------|------|---------------|
| Approved QRs | `{quality_location}/QR-*.md` (identified by user) | FULL_LOAD |
| Release notes | User or auto-generated from QRs | PROVIDED_BY_USER |
| Staging access | Environment details from user | PROVIDED_BY_USER |
| Monitoring setup | Dashboards and alert definitions | PROVIDED_BY_USER |

## Execution

<workflow>

<step n="1" goal="Identify release scope and gather approved QRs">
<action>Ask user for:</action>
  - Release type (Major / Minor / Patch / Hotfix)
  - Version number (e.g., v1.2.3)
  - Release name or codename
  - Which QR records are going into this release (QR-001, QR-002, ...)

<action>For each QR identified:</action>
  - Load `{quality_location}/QR-{id}.md`
  - Extract: story reference (S-XXX), decision status (must be APPROVED)
  - Verify decision = APPROVED (if not, exclude from release scope)
  - Extract: AC verification status, DoD verification status, code review approval
  - Extract: any breaking changes or tech debt

<action>Compile release scope:</action>

```
Release: v1.2.3 (Minor Release)
Approved QRs in scope:
  - QR-001: S-001 — User authentication (APPROVED)
  - QR-002: S-002 — Account management (APPROVED)
  - QR-003: S-003 — Settings page (APPROVED)
Total: 3 QRs, 3 stories
```

<action>Check for issues:</action>
  - [ ] Any QR not APPROVED? → Exclude from release
  - [ ] Any breaking changes? → Plan migration
  - [ ] Any tech debt? → Document and plan remediation
</step>

<step n="2" goal="Gather staging environment and deployment details">
<action>Ask user for:</action>
  - Staging environment URL or name
  - CI/CD pipeline name or deployment method (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins, manual script)
  - Estimated deployment duration (e.g., 5 minutes)
  - Who will perform the deployment (user role/name)
  - Any pre-deployment steps (database backup, config update, etc.)

<action>Ask about release timeline:</action>
  - Planned deploy date/time (UTC)
  - Deploy window duration (typically 1-2 hours for monitoring)
  - Any blackout periods or freeze times (e.g., no deploys on Friday evening)

<action>Record deployment plan:</action>

```
Deployment Method: GitHub Actions (push to main branch)
Staging Deployment: https://staging.myapp.com
Pre-deploy: database backup script (backup.sh)
Estimated duration: 10 minutes
Planned deploy time: 2025-02-20 14:00 UTC
Deploy window: 2 hours (includes 1 hour post-deploy monitoring)
```
</step>

<step n="3" goal="Plan and document staging tests">
<action>Define smoke tests (quick critical path tests):</action>
  - For each story in QR scope, identify 1-2 critical user flows
  - Example: "User can log in and create a post" (tests auth + API)
  - Example: "Settings change persists" (tests persistence)

<action>Ask user to provide:</action>
  - Manual test scenarios (if any) or accept auto-generated list
  - E2E test commands (if automated tests exist)
  - Critical path definition

<action>Create smoke test plan:</action>

```
Smoke Tests:
1. User authentication:
   - Test: POST /api/login with valid credentials
   - Expect: 200 OK, JWT token returned
   - Method: curl or pytest

2. Account settings:
   - Test: PATCH /api/user/settings (change timezone)
   - Expect: 200 OK, timezone updated in response
   - Method: curl or pytest

3. UI smoke test (if web frontend):
   - Test: Load homepage, login, navigate to dashboard
   - Expect: all pages load without errors
   - Method: manual or Selenium

End-to-end integration test:
  - Full user workflow: signup → verify email → create post → logout
  - Method: E2E test suite (e.g., Cypress, Playwright)
```

<action>Record planned smoke test status as "⏳ planned" initially</action>
</step>

<step n="4" goal="Plan rollback strategy">
<action>Ask user or determine:</action>
  - [ ] Is this a backward-compatible release?
  - [ ] Does this require database migrations?
  - [ ] Are any APIs being deprecated or changed?
  - [ ] Are there feature flags that can be toggled off?

<action>Choose rollback method based on answers:</action>

| Scenario | Rollback Method |
|----------|-----------------|
| Backward-compatible + no DB change | Rolling (instant per-instance) |
| Backward-compatible + reversible DB | Blue-green (toggle traffic) |
| Breaking change + DB destructive | Requires pre-planning + flag rollout |

<action>Define rollback triggers:</action>

```
Rollback triggers:
1. Error rate > 5% (alerting threshold) for > 2 minutes
2. Latency p95 > 500ms (baseline: 200ms)
3. Crash rate > 1% of requests
4. Database connection failures detected
5. Manual rollback (initiated by SRE)
```

<action>Plan rollback steps:</action>

```
Rollback Steps (Blue-green):
1. Monitor metrics first 5 minutes post-deploy
2. If trigger detected, notify on-call team
3. Stop routing new traffic to green deployment
4. Keep green deployment up for 1 hour (debugging)
5. Route traffic back to blue (previous version)
6. Run smoke test on blue to confirm
7. Blue confirmed working → green can be terminated
Estimated rollback time: < 2 minutes
```

<action>If database migration needed:</action>
  - [ ] Is migration reversible?
  - [ ] If yes: document rollback SQL
  - [ ] If no: document impact and prevent rollback-without-data-loss
  - [ ] Test migration rollback in staging

<action>Record rollback readiness: "⏳ planned, tested in staging" or "✓ ready"</action>
</step>

<step n="5" goal="Set up monitoring and alerting">
<action>Ask user for or identify:</action>
  - Which metrics are most critical for this release?
  - Existing monitoring dashboard (e.g., Datadog, New Relic, CloudWatch)
  - Alerting system (e.g., Slack, PagerDuty, email)

<action>Define critical metrics:</action>

```
Business metrics:
- Daily Active Users (DAU)
- Transaction success rate
- Revenue (if applicable)

Technical metrics:
- Response time (p50, p95, p99)
- Error rate (5xx, 4xx by endpoint)
- CPU usage
- Memory usage
- Database connection pool usage
- Queue depth (if async tasks exist)
```

<action>Define alerting rules:</action>

```
Critical Alerts (page on-call):
- Error rate > 5% for > 2 min → PagerDuty + Slack #incidents
- Latency p95 > 500ms for > 5 min → PagerDuty + Slack #incidents
- CPU > 90% for > 10 min → PagerDuty + Slack #incidents

Warning Alerts (Slack only):
- Error rate > 2% for > 5 min → Slack #monitoring
- Memory > 80% → Slack #monitoring
- Disk usage > 85% → Slack #monitoring
```

<action>Test alerts:</action>
  - [ ] Generate test alert in staging
  - [ ] Confirm alert fires to correct channel
  - [ ] Confirm on-call receives notification
  - Status: "✓ alerts tested" or "⏳ pending test"

<action>Configure logging:</action>

```
Log aggregation: ELK Stack (ElasticSearch)
Log retention: 30 days for debugging window
Structured logging: all logs JSON with timestamp, service, level, trace-id
Query: "service:myapp AND level:error" (to find all errors post-deploy)
```

<action>Record monitoring status: "✓ dashboard + alerts ready" or "⏳ pending setup"</action>
</step>

<step n="6" goal="Plan feature flags and gradual rollout (if applicable)">
<action>Ask user:</action>
  - [ ] Are any features behind feature flags?
  - [ ] Do we want gradual rollout (canary/rollout)?

<action>If yes, define feature flag plan:</action>

```
Feature Flags:
1. new-dashboard-ui (new experience)
   - Initial rollout: 0% (disabled)
   - Staged rollout: 10% (1 hour) → 50% (2 hours) → 100% (4 hours)
   - Kill switch: Slack /ff new-dashboard-ui off
   
2. new-api-endpoint (backward-compatible)
   - Rollout: 100% immediately (no canary needed)
```

<action>Define kill switch:</action>

```
Kill switch: which features can be toggled off instantly?
- new-dashboard-ui: YES (no data loss, users see old UI)
- new-api-endpoint: YES (falls back to old endpoint)
- database-schema-change: NO (would require data migration)

On-call runbook:
  1. Detected issue with new-dashboard-ui
  2. Run: /ff new-dashboard-ui off
  3. All users revert to old UI instantly (no reload needed)
  4. Investigate root cause
```

<action>If no feature flags:</action>
  - Record: "No feature flags used. Rollback method: {blue-green/rolling/instant}"

<action>Document deploy runbook:</action>

```
PRODUCTION DEPLOY RUNBOOK

PRE-DEPLOY (1 hour before):
1. Notify team: "Deploy v1.2.3 starting at 14:00 UTC in #ops"
2. Run database backup: ./scripts/backup-db.sh
3. Confirm staging smoke tests passed
4. Confirm no ongoing incidents

DEPLOY (at 14:00 UTC):
1. Trigger CI/CD: git push origin main → GitHub Actions kicks off
2. Monitor deployment in real-time
3. Wait for all instances to be healthy (< 5 min)

POST-DEPLOY (30-60 minutes):
1. Run smoke tests on production
2. Monitor error rate, latency, CPU
3. Check dashboard for anomalies
4. Keep team on standby

POST-MONITORING (1 hour):
1. If no issues → mark deploy SUCCESS
2. If issues detected → initiate rollback
3. Document lessons learned

TROUBLESHOOTING:
- Deployment stuck: check CI/CD logs in GitHub Actions
- High error rate: check error logs in ELK
- Database migration failed: check migration logs
  Rollback DB: ./scripts/rollback-db.sh
```

<action>Document incident response:</action>

## Gate 4 Checklist

Production Readiness generation enforces **Gate 4** of the methodology chain:
- All approved quality records (QRs) are in scope
- Staging deployment tests planned and ready
- Rollback plan defined and preferably tested
- Monitoring and alerting configured
- Runbook prepared with pre/during/post-deploy steps
- Incident response plan ready
- Change approval obtained
- Only then: PR is marked READY and deployment can proceed

This gate ensures operational readiness and minimizes production incident risk.

## Status Values for PR

- **preparing**: PR being created or reviewed
- **READY**: All checks passed, ready for production deployment
- **WAITING**: Gaps identified, complete before deploying
- **deployed** (post-deploy section): Deployment completed

## Release Type Guidelines

- **Major** (v1.0 → v2.0): Breaking changes, significant feature additions
- **Minor** (v1.2 → v1.3): New backward-compatible features
- **Patch** (v1.2.3 → v1.2.4): Bug fixes, security patches
- **Hotfix** (v1.2.3-hotfix): Emergency production fix
